# GEOG5712M-Group-Project
A group project created for the Programming for Data Science (COMP5712M) module assignment. Within this project, we investigated local and regional greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2022. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, aggregating emissions by sector and region. We visualised emission patterns through charts and geospatial plots, and compared emissions intensity per capita. We identified the top 5 emitting local authorities in each sector, with a breakdown of emissions by sector.
